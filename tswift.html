    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative lyricism, which often takes inspiration from her personal life and experiences, has received widespread critical praise and media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004, to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous debut studio album in 2006, which included the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country-pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".</p>
